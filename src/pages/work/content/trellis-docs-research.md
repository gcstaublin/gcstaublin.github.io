As we kicked off the project, we talked with designers and engineers. We were well-aware of the challenges designers were facing interacting with and discovering resources and guidance within Storybook. However, we were surprised to learn of the friction engineers were facing within Storybook. In some cases, engineers had fully abandoned Storybook and were relying on UI Library for their documentation needs.
