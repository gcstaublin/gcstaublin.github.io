title: "The listening tour"

Any good solution starts with hearing from the community to understand what would make their lives better.

We kicked off the project, with short conversations with designers and engineers. While we were already well-aware of the challenges designers were facing interacting with and discovering resources and guidance within Storybook, the engineering perspective was eye-opening.

We originally assumed that engineers all in on Storybook. However, our conversations uncovered a much different paradigm. While engineers tried to use Storybook, many found it too slow and "too fussy" for their needs. In many cases they ultimately abandoned Storybook for the faster and more easy to use UI Library.
