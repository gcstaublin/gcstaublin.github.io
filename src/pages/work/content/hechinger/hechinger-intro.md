title: "A bold new identity to match the quality of Hechinger's journalism"
---

During my time at Upstatement, I had the pleasure to working with some wonderful clients, like The Hechinger Report.

The Hechinger Report is a nonprofit newsroom covering issues of inequality and innovation in education. The quality of Hechinger's journalism is top-notch. However their site wasn't conveying the quality of their work.

During our initial client meeting, a member of the Hechinger staff jokingly described themseleves as looking like a 1990s Pontiac, rather than a quality journalistis endeavor.

### Goals of the project

- Design an identity and responsive website that reflects the quality and distince voice of Hechinger's content.

- Help people understand who Hechinger is and what it does.

- Lay the foundation for The Hechinger Reprot to become a destination new site.
