title: "Bold design, considering constraints"

The design vision needed to account for the realities of a small non-profit organization creating quality journalism on a daily basis, including:

- Good photography is inconsistently available.

- Small staff, not a lot of time to actively manage the site on a daily basis.

- No full-time design staff

The site design leaned into nuanced usage of typography and integrated with Wordpress to make site updating and maintenance realistic, considering resources.
