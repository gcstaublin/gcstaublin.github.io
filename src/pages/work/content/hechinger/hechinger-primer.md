title: "Experimenting with storytelling ideas"
---

Hechinger dives deep into a number of specialized topics, like Common Core.

In addition to creating a flexible special topic landing page, we also experimented with an idea we called The Primer. The idea of The Primer was to give Hechinger another storytelling tool to introduce complex education topics in a digestable and consumable way. This concept was a value add idea we worked through once we the core of the new site was built.
