title: "Leveraging Trellis Design Tokens"
---

The new Trellis Design Docs are an early adopter of the new and evolving Trellis Design Token System. The site hints at visual language changes to come and unlocks the ability to have dark mode.

### Outcome

Trellis Design Docs launched mid-Q4 of 2024. The analytics already show growing traffic and we've heard lots of anecdotal appreciation for out efforts. The Design Token documentation has already proved extremely useful for designers beginning to plan out how to migrate existing features onto the new token system.

There's a long way to go, but this new documentation site should be the launchpad for all design system consumers.
