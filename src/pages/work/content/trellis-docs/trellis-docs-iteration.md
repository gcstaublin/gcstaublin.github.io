title: "Quick, tight design iterations and considering the tech stack"
---

The site design quickly evolved from gray box content wireframes to rough designs to working prototypes. All three of us iterated on designs, refining and volley ideas back and forth.

On the technical side, me and the other design technologist on the team explore a few options for building the site. I explored an Astro-based approach, while the other DT tested a Next JS approach. In the end we ultimately decided to opt the product team's existing front-end tooling. The platform team's tooling is design to build the HubSpot, but by staying within the existing tooling, we would receive more support than if we had opted for a tool like Astro or Next JS.

Design ideas continued to evolve while the other design technologist and myself built the site.
