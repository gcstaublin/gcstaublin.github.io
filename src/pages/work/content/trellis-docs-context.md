title: "Short history of design system documentation"
---

HubSpot's Canvas design system launched in 2015. The system was documented via a bespoke, homemade solution, known as UI Library.

UI Library offered many table stakes attributes of a design system documentation site: editable code snippets, deep linking to individual specification, quick, visual search and most of all an IA that facilitates discovery.

As great as UI Library was for design system consumers, it had one major flaw. The tool was too tightly coupled with the one component library associated with the design system. For years, product teams requested use of UI Library to document their own group-level component libraries and subsystems. Unfortunately, this wasn't feasible.

Enter Storybook. Storybook aimed to fill this gap for product teams. The Storybook aspirations quickly expanded to include all documentation, including the design system itself.

As good as Storybook is with component documentation, it can be challenging to create nuanced, long form design-centric documentation.

This left us at a crossroads, we had a legacy UI Library site as well as a Storybook site. UI Library's usage remained too high to fully deprecate and remove, and complaints about the usability of Storybook were a going concern.




<!-- From 2015 – 2022 the primary avenue for design system documentation was a hand-built site, known internally as UI Library. The site offered many of the table stakes attributes of a documentation site, including editable code snippets, visual search, easy of use and discovery. In 2022, the design system engineering team made the decision to migrate design system documentation to Storybook. -->

<!-- There are many advantages of a Storybook approach documentation solution, including availability for teams beyond the design system team. One complaint with UI Library was that it was so tightly coupled to the deisgn system component library, it inhibitied use by other teams, desiring a documentation solution. -->

<!-- Issue: While Storybook is wonderful for component development and testing, it lacks nuanced design documentation. Additionally, Storybook’s UI can adversely impact discoverability. -->

<!-- The challenges of Storybook left the team with a legacy documentation solution (UI Library) that was still too widely leveraged by both design and engineering to deprecate and remove. -->

Our three-person documentation tiger team aspired to improve upon the documentation paradigm.
