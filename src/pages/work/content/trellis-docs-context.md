title: "History of design system documentation"
---

From 2015 – 2022 the primary avenue for design system documentation was a hand-built site, known internally as UI Library. The site offered many of the table stakes attributes of a documentation site, including editable code snippets, visual search, easy of use and discovery. In 2022, the design system engineering team made the decision to migrate design system documentation to Storybook.

There are many advantages of a Storybook approach documentation solution, including availability for teams beyond the design system team. One complaint with UI Library was that it was so tightly coupled to the deisgn system component library, it inhibitied use by other teams, desiring a documentation solution.

Issue: While Storybook is wonderful for component development and testing, it lacks nuanced design documentation. Additionally, Storybook’s UI can adversely impact discoverability.

The challenges of Storybook left the team with a legacy documentation solution (UI Library) that was still too widely leveraged by both design and engineering to deprecate and remove.

Improving upon this paradigm was our central focus.
