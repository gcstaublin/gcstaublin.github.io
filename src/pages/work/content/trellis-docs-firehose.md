title: "Connecting consumers to resources and information"
---

In my experience, large enterprise organizations have an information problem. There's no shortage of information. Rather, there's too much of it â€¦ or more likely, information that is published across multiple platforms. This leads to information that is either lost to the ether (think Slack) or never found (think your orgnaization's wiki). The Trellis Design Docs aims to connect design system users to information and resources.

We had a few primary types of information and resources we wanted to surface on the homepage to help consumers throughout the evolution:

1. <strong>High-level roadmap.</strong> The design system will ask alot of of teams throughout 2025. The homepage, communicates the high-level plan to help teams understand and plan for what's happening today, and what's coming tomorrow.
1. <strong>Connections to product-area subsystems.</strong> HubSpot has a few systems that are owned and maintained by specific product ground. If a designer is creating an onboarding experience, they need to be aware of the Onboarding Experience System from our Growth team.
1. <strong>Links to articles and presentations.</strong> It's easy to miss information. This section of the homepage surfaces the design system's monthly update, wiki posts from the VP of Design, as well as recorded presentations that are relevant to the design system and the Trellis evolution.
