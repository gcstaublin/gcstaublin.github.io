title: "Base level need for a refined set of design tokens"
---

Shortly after joining HubSpot in the fall of 2019, I identified an opportunity to better embrace design tokens within the system.

The React component library of 300-plus components was leveraging an existing systems of variables. As I inspected the system, I realized the variables system consisted of two layers, consisting of:
* An un-opinonated base layer. These variables described the visual language of the design system but lacked meaning. This is how the majority of components were styled.
* A very contextually precice set of component tokens that provided sparse coverage across the component library's needs.

Given the sparse coverage of componenet-specific tokens, the base layer was widely applied within the component library.

The system and its consumers would likely benefit from better semantic distinction.

I assumed selling the idea of improving the token system would be a slam dunk.

Unfortunately, in 2019, the appetite to invest in an improved token system was low. One engineer casually told me that "Design tokens are just implementation details." This sent a clear signal just where we were on our design system journey. I knew this would take some time, and I'd need to wait for the right strategic moment.

I outlined a proposal, hit save and waited for the right moment.

I continued evangelizing design tokens when I could strategically work it into tactical conversations.

<!-- I described scenarios when the organization was hit by an ADA lawsuit, related to the color contrast issues in the system, or the moment the C-Suite wanted to radically evolve the visual language of the product. -->

Primarily, I waited for a moment of opportunity.
