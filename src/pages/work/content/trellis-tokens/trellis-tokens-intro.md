title: "A greenfield opportunity"

Shortly after joining HubSpot in the fall of 2019, I identified an opportunity to better embrace design tokens within the system.

The React component library of 300-plus components was leveraging an existing systems of variables. As I dug a little deeper, I recognized an opportunity to establish a more solid foundation for the system and for our product teams consuming the system.

The existing system consisted of two layers:
* An un-opinonated base layer. These variables described the visual language of the design system but lacked meaning. This is how the majority of components were styled.
* A very contextually precice set of component tokens that provided sparse coverage across the component library's needs.

In most instances, the base layer variables were applying style to the component library.

The system could benefit from better semantic distinction.

I assumed selling the idea of improving the token system would be a slam dunk.

I was wrong. In 2019, the appetite to invest in an improved token system was low. One engineer casually told me that "Design tokens are just implementation details;" a phrase that indicated to me where we were in our design system journey. I knew I'd wait for the right strategic moment.

I wrote a proposal, filed it into the growing folder of other proposals and waited for that moment.

Over the course of the next couple years, I evangelized tokens when I could strategically work it into tactical conversations.

<!-- I described scenarios when the organization was hit by an ADA lawsuit, related to the color contrast issues in the system, or the moment the C-Suite wanted to radically evolve the visual language of the product. -->

Primarily, I waited for a moment of opportunity.
