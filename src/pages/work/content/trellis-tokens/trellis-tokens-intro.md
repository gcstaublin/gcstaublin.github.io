title: "A greenfield opportunity"

This is a story of triumph. This is a story of failure. This is a story of organizational change and tactical pivots. Grab some popcorn it's going to be fun.

Shortly after joing HubSpot in the fall of 2019, I identified an opportunity to better embrace design tokens within the system.

The React component library (300-plus components) was leveraging an existing "token system," but when I examined how tokens were applied to individual components, I realized this token system could generally be summed up as a collection of variables. A collection of variables that described the base colors of the Canvas visual language but not much else. Said another way. The token system primarily described the building blocks of the visual language but failed to create semantic distinctions from those building blocks.

In all fairness, there were a semantic variables here and there, describing design decisions like the default color of text in the product. However, those semantic distinctions seemed more of an individual decision made by an engineer rather than a guiding design system principle.

This space was a greenfield of opportunity.

Unfortunately, it took me a few years to get everybody onboard with the idea and seize the opportunity. More on that in the next section.

wrote proposal. filed it away. waited for my moment.
