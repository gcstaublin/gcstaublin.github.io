title: "Learning. Sharing process and progress"

In addition to audits, I wanted to level up my own token knowledge. The thinking related to design tokens had evolve since I was on the Uniform team at Hudl so I wanted to refresh my and level up my knowledge.

As part of my own learning I wanted to bring the team along on the journey and find ways to include them not only with updates but also opportunities to invovle them without pulling them away from their assigned project.

Each week, both functions of our team meet for a Design and Engineering Jam.

Over the course of a few weeks I took 15â€“30 minutes of our Jam sharing one specific consideration related to design tokens. To prevent turning these sessions into a weekly Ted Talk I strived to make them interactive through open feedback exercises, voting opportunities and always soliciting any additional support were willing and able to offer.
