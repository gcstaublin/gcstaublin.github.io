The Design Language Playground showcased four primary design language levers:
* <strong>Classic:</strong> HubSpot current visual language.
* <strong>Dark:</strong> A hypothetical example of a HubSpot with a dark mode.
* <strong>Simple:</strong> An alterate take on HubSpot's visual language.
* <strong>Technical:</strong> Reimagining HubSpot in the developer-centric terminal-like interface.

Each lever altered the color palette, typography, shape language and illustrations.

Additionally, a user could further alter a the selected theme with granular dials for over layout density and type face.
