title: "Showing the value of Tokens with a Playground site"
---

In Q3 of 2023, the C-Suite asked for an example site to serve as a "roadshow" for an upcoming leadership event.

With my original engineering partner back from family leave, we build the Design Language Playground over the course of about a sprint and a half.

While the development work was handled by myself and my engineer, the design of the individual concepts was a team effort between myself, two other designers and even our design director.

The layground showcases four primary design language levers:
* <strong>Classic:</strong> HubSpot current visual language.
* <strong>Dark:</strong> A hypothetical example of a HubSpot with a dark mode.
* <strong>Simple:</strong> An alterate take on HubSpot's visual language.
* <strong>Technical:</strong> Reimagining HubSpot in the developer-centric terminal-like interface.

Each lever altered the color palette, typography, shape language and illustrations.

Additionally, a user could further refine a selected theme with granular dials, controlling layout density and type face.

It highlighted various directions and opportunities we could offer for increased user control with a design token driven product.
