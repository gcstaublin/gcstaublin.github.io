title: "Kicking off the work"

My engineering partner departed on family leave shortly after we wrote our proposal, leaving me as the sole IC focused on tokens in the early stages of the project.

<!-- As the first design hire on the design systems hire, I was more than accustomed to being the sole IC on a project. However, I was sad to have lost my partner in crime during the early stages of the project. -->

I knew bringing the team along on the journey would be an important aspect of these early stages.

During our weekly Design and Engineering meeting I would spend about 15 minutes covering a topic related to tokens, ... to level up the team and provide a weekly update on my work. As part of the leveling up, I'd make the sessions interactive. Whether iit was voting the naming of our token layers, or a free form feedback, I wanted to bring the team along as best I could.
