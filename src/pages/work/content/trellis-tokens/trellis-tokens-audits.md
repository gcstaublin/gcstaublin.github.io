title: "Kicking off. Auditing. Learning."

The engineering partner I'd collaborated with on the proposal departed on family leave shortly after we received the thumbs up from our leadership. This left me as the primary IC focused on the creation of the token system during the early stages of the project.

Thankfully, another engineer stepped in to help with the early audits of our component library. They wrote a script to find all the style values that were applied to components. The script pulled SASS declartions as well as nuanced Styled Component conditionals, leaving us with a big pile of values. I combed through the values and began contextualizing and organizing those values into categorized buckets.

One unique challenge with the design system, is that there are a number of sneaky design decisions that didn't "offically" exist in our visual language or the existing token system. These bespoke visual atoms included aspects like type specs of a button, the hover state of a link or some unique disabled text colors that deviated from all other disabled text colors. As painful it was to document those examples might have been, I was super excited to be establishing a method of erradicating them in the future.
