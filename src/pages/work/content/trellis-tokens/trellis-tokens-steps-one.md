title: "Create a Taxonomy and naming convention"
---

In addition to finishing up the initial rounds of audits, I began iterating on establishing a taxonomy and naming convention for the new token system.

The evolving naming convention was inspired by my previous work on the Uniform Design System at Hudl, articles by Nathan Curtis and Nate Baldwin and other design system examples, including Polaris, REI Cedar, Atlassian and Material Design. I weighed the needs those systems solve for, compared to our own needs.

After some quick rounds of iteration and stress testing the naming convention, I shared my progress with the team to solicit feedback.

The initial naming convention came together over the course of a two-week sprint. As I iterated I created proof of conception tokens, that I was then ran through a local instance of Style dictionary on my computer.

In addition to sharing the progress live in our weekly Design and Engineering Jam, I made loom walking through my process and seeking feedback.
