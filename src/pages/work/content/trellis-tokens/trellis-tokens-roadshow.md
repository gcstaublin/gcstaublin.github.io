title: "Quick detour to create a proof of concept for leadership"
---

A few months into our design tokens journey, HubSpot was preparing for a leadership council meeting. Our EVP of Design and our Chief Product Officer wanted a visual, interactive artifact to communicate the value of design tokens to leadership and board of director types.

My engineering partners (back from parental leave) and I created a Design Language Playground to highlight the possiblities of a design tokens driven HubSpot product. The Playground was turned around during a two-week sprint.
