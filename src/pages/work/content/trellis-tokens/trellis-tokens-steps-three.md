title: "Design Token Naming Worksheet"
---

Once the naming convention felt solid, I created a Fig Jam template that would allow anyone to create a new file and begin creating their own tokens, as needed.

At this point, I was to sole token creating, but I assumed eventually the entire team would be contributing to growing the system so I wanted to establish a resource from the begining that would help us keep the token system cohesive as it scaled.
