In Q4 of 2023 a number of significant changes occurred.

* Though we had settled on re-naming the design system from Canvas to HDS (HubSpot Design System), the tides had turned amongst leadership. We decided to rebrand the design system as Trellis, rather than HDS.
* HubSpot hired an external design agency to begin creating a refined and evolved brand identity, that would re-align Brand with Product and add the concept of dark mode and theming into the mix.
* Our Design system engineering team decided to pivot their React component modernization strategy they'd been following through the second half of 2023.

And in early 2024 I was going to need to rotate away as the primary owner of the token system and onto some high value Storybook/documentation-related work.

_Stay tuned for the phase 2 of the token system._
