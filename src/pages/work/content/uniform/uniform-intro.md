In 2015, Hudl had a successful, growing product.

But without a design system, the product was beginning to drift away from coherency and was beginning to wrestle with technical debt.

The Uniform Design Team (we were originally called Kickoff) spun up in mid-August 2015. I joined Hudl in early July, hoping to become one of the four people to comprise the first interation of our design systems team. Thankfully, the team was established, and I was able to join. This "officially" started my design system journey.

As our team spun up we identified some immediate opportunities to create impact and provide value. We knew we wanted and needed to evolve the visual language, but first we needed to lay some technical foundations to set the stage for our future design system aspirations.

My early focus centered on a few key areas:

- Empowering and teaching product teams to write better, more performant CSS

- Creating a distributed source of truth for CSS-related concerns.

- Improving the quality of HTML across the product with semantic HTML.

<!-- ### Empowering front-end development

In the years before I joined Hudl, I architected a lot of CSS for a number of responsive web projects and products. Being trusted to do that for Hudl's emerging desing system was right up my alley.

- Create and document opinonated guidance on CSS best practices

- Create an NPM package to distribute the CSS architecture, SCSS mixins and variables as our system's initial source of truth.

- Create a documentation site to demonstrate the CSS and semantic HTML that would serve as the foundation of a new React component library. -->
