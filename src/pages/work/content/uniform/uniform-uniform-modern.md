title: "Establishing a first class home for documentation"
---

The UniDocs site was always considered to be a temporary solution. In 2016, we the Uniform design lanauage evolved and we began bulding a React component library and better Sketch resources, we knew it was time to establish a better home for documentation.

As a first step, I evaluated a few static site generators. I tested Jekyll (our solution for UniDocs), Gatsby, Hugo and Hexo.

We had a few core needs our next site generator needed to address:

- Something that would allow us to host all (or most of) design system documentation.

- Seemless integration with our React components.

- Well supported open source ecosystem surrounding the technology.

- The ability to scale to meet the needs of the system.

Gatsby (hey, it was 2016) seemed like the slam dunk option to build upon.
