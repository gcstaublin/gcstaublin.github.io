title: "Countdown to Trellis"
---

Design Systems at HubSpot are at an inflection point in 2025. Over the next year, the product will evolve from its legacy design system, Canvas, to a new, future-focused design system known as Trellis.

The year of change will culminate with a new visual language, new Figma and React component libraries, a new mandate for product-level consistency and an eventual redesign of the product.

We needed to create a documentation site that could communicate status, facilitate discovery and help design system consumers apply the system.

In Q3 of 2024, a three-person team, consisting of myself as a Designer and Design Technologist, a Principal Designer and another Design Technologist kicked off a quest to launch a site that could match the aspirations of the Trellis design system.

We moved quickly and confidently during Q3 and into Q4, launching a new site that provides a more stable foundation for the documentation that exists today, as well as what will be created over the course of this design system evolution.
