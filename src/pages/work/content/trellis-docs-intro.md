title: "Countdown to Trellis"
---

Design Systems at HubSpot are at an inflection point in 2025. Over the next year, the product will evolve from its legacy design system, Canvas, to a new, future-leaning system known as Trellis.

The year of change will culminate with a new visual language, new Figma and React component libraries, a new mandate for product-level consistency and an eventual redesign of the product.

We needed to create a documentation site that could communicate status, facilitate discovery and help design system consumers find what they needed, when they nedded it.

In Q3 of 2024, a three-person team, consisting of myself as a Design and Design Technologist, a Principal Designer and another Design Technologist kicked off a quest to launch a site that could match the aspirations of the design system itself.

We moved quickly and confidently over the course of Q3 and into Q4, launching a new site that will be able to handle everything thrown at it over the course of this evolutionary period.
