title: "Sunday Business"

Daily business design is driven by market and economic news of the day. However, the Sunday Business section changes into casual clothes and lets its hair down, apealing to the interests of a more genearlized audience.

The Sunday section contextualizes the week that was, looks forward to what's on the horizon and offers a view into evolving business trends.

In most cases, the story selection is fluid and evovling. As an art director you're planning, reacting and re-thinking as the week unfolds. More often than not the art budget is limited, leaving you to create something out of nothing. It's fun. It's challenging. It's a grind.
