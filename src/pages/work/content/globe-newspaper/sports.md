title: "Did I reverse the curse?"

I joined The Boston Globe in early 2004. A few months later, The Boston Red Sox won their first World Series in 86 years. Say what you will about the bloody sock, Roberts stealing second or Derek Lowe's performance through the playoffs (the thing no one talks about), but it's clear that my Sports design work is the turning point for The Olde Towne Team.

I've always loved Sports design. It's the one news section in a newspaper where you leverage your skills as a hard news designer, a features designer and connecting with user sentiment. Having the opportunity to spend time in one of the most hearalded Sports design chairs in the country was always an honor.

When I joined The Globe, Boston sports teams were as in a period of sustained dominance. And in case you're wondering, I never did, nor will I ever become a Patriots fan.
