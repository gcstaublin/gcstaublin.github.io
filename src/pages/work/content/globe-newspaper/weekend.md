title: "Friday Weekend"

The Friday Weekend section sets the agenda for your weekend. It's usually full of movie reviews, music profiles and preview of upcoming art shows. The content is exciting. The art is often handout art that needs to be used.

Finding the line between creative liberty and clear communication is a balancing act. I often pushed myself, hoping to surprise readers with unexpected visual takes on the entertainment stories they expected to find when the opened up their Friday newspaper.
