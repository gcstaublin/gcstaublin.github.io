  - title: Plan for the Unexpected
    image: mike-test/Mike-page_tito.jpg
    text: In the news biz, things happen and you always need to be prepared. Evidently, that holds true for the goodbye page. This avatar was late in its arrival to my desk. It got lost somewhere between my desk and the desk of the adjacent cubicle. The design department did have taller than normal cubical walls. I'm guessing that's what happened. Editorial commentary aside. I knew exactly where this avatar would go the whole time. I was always thinking ahead, especting calamity. Thatâ€™s what always made me a fantastic designer in the newsroom.

  - title: Mistakes Make for Great Moments

    text: I can't remember exactly how this one avatar came to be black and white or half the size of all others, but it's one of my favorite parts of this page. I vaguely remember receiving a print, rather than a digital file for this submission. I might be making that up.

  - title: Be Bold, Yet Informative

    text: During my newspaper career, I loved to create designs that were visually striking but also intricately told a story. If all the asides were removed, this page would still be funny, but that's all it would be. The conversational moments are powerful. The conjure memories of that time all these years later.
