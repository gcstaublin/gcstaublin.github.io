headline: The Great Goodbye

The goodbye page is a right of passage in the editorial world. When a co-worker leaves the organization, he or she gets their very own font page replica, complete with photos and funny headlines and stories, encapsulating their time with the institution. I've designed my fair share of these. Some are better than others. The success of a goodbye page is totally on whomever is acting as the editor of the page, the person gathering content, writing the headlines and refining the stories. In 2007, my friend Mike Swartz spent six months at the Boston Globe, filling in for a designer on maternity leave. Those next few months provided plenty of material for best goodbye page of all-time.
