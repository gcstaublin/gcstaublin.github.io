It’s a right of passage in the editorial world of newspapers and magazines. A co-worker leaves, he or she gets their very own font page replica with lots of  photos and fake headlines, detailing their time with the institution. It’s the true definition of fake news. As someone who has designed many of these for other co-workers, some are better than others, and the success of a goodbye page is totally on whomever is acting as the editor of the page, the person gathering content, writing the headlines and refining the stories. Basically, how a newspaper works.

Usually, my role on these pages was designer. But the Summer of 2007, my friend Mike Swartz spent six months at the Boston Globe, filling in for a designer on maternity leave.
