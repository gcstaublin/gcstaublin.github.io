  - title: Everyone was a Simpsons Character

    text: The key to any successful project is hiring the right talent for the job. I hired the entire design department. Rather, I harrassed everyone until they went to the make your own Simpsons avatar website and re-imagined themselves as a character. Generally, most folks stayed true to themselves. Others made a few interesting artistic decisions.
  - title: The Dude Wore a Lobster Suit

    text: Why he wore a lobster suit isn't really important. What is important is that Mike wore the lobster suit. There's a lot to be said for someone who jumps in a does what needs to be done. Beyond that, the young man did some lovely work during his stint. I think he probably won more design awards in those six months than most of us earned working the full year. And I don't just mean the fake design awards I'd randomly leave at his desk once or twice a week.
  - title: The Red Floaty
    image: mike-test/Mike-page_floaty.jpg
    text: This dang thing was thrown around the department with great abandon. Pretty much everyone in the design department hated it. There were lots of threats, but none of the adults (managers) took it away. The floaty was just one part of the daily grind of jokes, stealing stuff from each other’s desk and various other hijinks. When I say the entire department hated the red floatly, it might be more appropriate to say the entire department hated Mike and I.
  - title: Plan for the Unexpected
    image: mike-test/Mike-page_tito.jpg
    text: In the news biz, things happen and you need to be prepared. That holds true for the goodbye page, too. Now, I’m not one to publically shame someone on the Internet, but this avatar definitely came in late in process. I’d planned for not having an avatar, adding a  “Where’s Tito” speech bubble to the page. When the avatar finally did come through, I left the original speech bubble on the page, thinking it was funny. I swear it’s not an editorial comment. True be told, I knew exactly where this avatar would go the whole time. That’s what always made me a fantastic designer in the news room.
  - title: Problems Can Become Solutions
    image: mike-test/Mike-page_bw.jpg
    text: A wise art director once told this tidbit from Coco Chanel&#58; "Before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off." I always liked that, and it's helped me along the way, reigning in overly stylized designs. I'm not sure why this avatar ended up B&W, I vaguely remember some sort of technical issue.
  - title: xxxx

    text: This is something that was said at times during those few months. This is a family website, though. It’s best left unexplained.
