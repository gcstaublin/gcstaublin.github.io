  - title: Everyone was a Simpsons character

    text: Making yourself into a Simpons characgter has to be some sort of personality test. As we created our own likenesses, we taped them to a wall next the lunch table in the department. I remember sitting and eating lunch staring at these characters, wondering ‘really, is that how you see yourself.’ That might say a little too much about my own personality.
  - title: The dude wore a lobster suit

      - The Globe was hosting a design conference in fall of 2007. The concept was to create a promotional video for the conference with a staff member wearing a lobster suit. Two particular staff members were singled out as potential lobsters. Both were pretty adament that they would not be wearing said suit. Mike jumped in with a smile and nailed it. I’m guessing at this point of his life, Mike would rather his role of Larry The Lobster wasn’t no longer associated with him. Did I mention I still have a copy of the movie, and could totally post it to the internet at any point. Not that I’m asking Mike to send me some crypto currency.
  - title: The hated red floaty

    text: The entire department hated this thing. It was thrown around the department with great abandon. There were lots of threats, but none of the adults (managers) took it away from us. The floatly was just one piece of the daily grind of jokes, stealing stuff from each other’s desk and various other hijinks. When I say the entire department hated the red floatly, it might be more appropriate to say the entire department hated Mike and I.
  - title: Plan for the unexpected
    image: mike-test/Mike-page_tito.jpg
    text: In the news biz, stories evolve, or happen out of thin air. You need to be prepared for that. That holds true for the goodbye page, too. Now, I’m not one to publically shame someone on the Internet, but this avatar definitely came in late in process. I’d planned for not having an avatar, adding a  “Where’s Tito” speech bubble to the page. When the avatar finally did come through, I left the original speech bubble on the page, thinking it was funny. I swear it’s not an editorial comment. True be told, I knew exactly where this avatar would go the whole time. That’s what always made me a fantastic designer in the news room.
  - title: new headline here

    text: Getting everyone to buy into making themselves into a Simpsons avatar wasn’t easy. I may or may have not pestered some folks until they finally made one. For some reason, this avatar wasn’t saved when it was created, but it was printed out.

    text: This is something that was said at times during those few months. This is a family website, though. It’s best left unexplained.
