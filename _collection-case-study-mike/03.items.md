  - title: Gentle Prodding as Art Direction

    text: Unfortunately, art direction isn't all waving your hands in the air, saying smart, creative things. Usually, you're acting as a defacto project manager, making sure words, images and otherwise are all on schedule and cohesive enough to make the final product. Pestering the design department until they took the five minutes to create their own Simpsons character was not the easiest bit of coordination.

  - title: He Wore a Lobster Suit!

    text: There are good sports. Then are people who will put on a lobster suit for the cause. Why this was neccessary isn't really important. What is important is that Mike wore the lobster suit. There's a lot to be said for someone who jumps in a does what needs to be done. Outside of this moment, the young man did some lovely work during his stint. I think he probably won more design awards (if you measure success like that) in those six months than most of the design department earned the entire year. I'm not even counting the fake design awards I'd randomly leave at his desk once or twice a week.

  - title: The Red Floaty
    image: mike-test/Mike-page_floaty.jpg
    text: This dang thing was thrown around the department with great abandon. Pretty much everyone in the design department hated it. There were lots of threats, but none of the adults (managers) took it away. The floaty was just one part of the daily grind of jokes, stealing stuff from each otherâ€™s desk and various other hijinks. When I say the entire department hated the red floatly, it might be more appropriate to say the entire department hated Mike and I.

One key aspect of a great design or product is that it represents the organization's brand and identity. This page is a perfect summarization of Mike's time at the Globe. It's bright. It's smart. It's full of jokes and fun. Here a few details that make this a wonderful send off.
