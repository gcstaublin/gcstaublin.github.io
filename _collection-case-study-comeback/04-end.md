I knew almost immediately what I wanted to do with the two covers. I spent the next hour or so, doing photo research and sketching out the the idea for the 2004 cover. I took a quick stab at writing the text for a couple of the moments and showed the idea to the Sports editors. They loved it. The next few hours involved refining the list of moments we planned to highlight on both pages, writing the text, doing more photo research and getting the first of the two covers ready for the copy desk to have a crack at tearing everything apart.-
