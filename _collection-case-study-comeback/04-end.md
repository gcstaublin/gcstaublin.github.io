Playoff runs, especially baseball, are exhausting. You get few days off. The games drag well past early deadlines and while you're waiting for a game to end, you're working on advance ideas. But it's fun. The 2004 playoff run was special. The Red Sox lost Game 3 of the 2004 ALCS, 19-8. It seemed like the coffin was one nail away from being shut. I took off my Red Sox hat, made an 'X' with electical tape, put it over the Sox logo and threw my hat on the table. The next night the Sox won. The house rule became "Don't touch the Red Sox hat." It sat on coffee table for the next week or so, while they completed their World Series run. Once the playoffs are over and you're back to your regular schedule, you miss it. I should add that if the playoff run in question involves the Patriots, you hate every last second of it. You do good work, but you root for the other guys each and every game. Don't tell the rest of New England that's how I feel, but that is how I feel.
