Red Sox fans lived a tortured existence for 86 years; decades filled with random moments of heart break. Bucky ‘Bleeping’ Dent, Bill Buckner, Aaron Boone; the names wrote painful chapters in Olde Towne Team's book of curses. 2004 and 2007 looked no different. However those unfortunate chapters were never written, as you probably already know. Both World Series victories were accentuated with miraculous comebacks in the ALCS.

This is the story behind the comebacks from the perspective of a designer with little time or resources.
