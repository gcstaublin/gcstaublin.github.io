Red Sox fans lived 86 years of tortured existence. Those decades were filled random moments of heart break at the hands of Bucky ‘bleeping’ Dent, Aaron Boone, etc . 2004 and 2007 seemed likely to become additional chapters in the Olde Towne Team’s book of curses. However those unfortunate chapters were not written, as you might already know. Both playoffs runs accentuated with miraculous comebacks in the ALCS. These two pages ran on successive days in The Boston Globe, documenting those memorable moments. This is the story behind the comebacks from the perspective of a designer with little time or resources.
