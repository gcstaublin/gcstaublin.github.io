headline: A series of improbable moments

I knew almost immediately how I wanted to approach the two covers. The 2004 comeback had so many indelible moments: Dave Roberts' stolen base, Schilling's bloody sock and Big Papi's walkoffs. So I spent the next hour or so, doing photo research and sketching out the idea for the 2004 cover. I took a quick stab at writing the text for a couple of the moments and showed the idea to the Sports editors. They loved it. The next few hours involved refining the list of moments we planned to highlight, writing and refining text, doing more photo research and getting the first of the two covers ready for the copy desk to have a crack at tearing everything apart.
