    text: Uniform is the design system for Hudl, a sports video company, whose mission is to help coaches, athletes and teams win. During it's first decade, Hudl rapidly grew from an upstart focused on american football to a global company, helping users of all sports. Without a cohesive, codified design language, design debt grew as Hudl expanded into new sports and new geographies. Uniform provides a shared, unified system for designers and developers to build cohesive products. During my tenure at Hudl, I was a member of the small, collborative team, trusted to create this system for our growing and expanding suite of products. I served as the lead css developer, occasional React component wrestler and primary accesibility czar.

    text: In my previous life as a print designer and art director, I designed my fair share of goodbye pages for departing colleagues. They're a fun way to send them off with a laugh.

    text: If you are a designer at a newspaper, one of the best assignments you can have is working in the Sports department. The hours are long and sometimes it's a grind, but it's worth it. This case study examines the Red Sox's comeback in the 2004 and 2007 ALCS. Along with <a class="link--work" href="/work/goodbye-mike/">this page</a>, it was an exercise in thinking through an approach to case studies.
