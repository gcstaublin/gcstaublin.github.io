  # intro: I'm mostly friendly. I enjoy coffee, music and running, as well as my dog and my wife; not in that order, though.
  words:
    - Currently, I'm a designer on the design systems team at HubSpot. As the first full-time design hire for the team, my focus has often fallen somewhere between product owner, an advocate for team growth, creative organization problem solver, tool owner and sometimes a designer. Every year, month and day present unique challenges of addressing scale and growth and a design system's relationship to those orgainzational and product needs while never relenting on trying to improve the quality of our work.
    - Prior to HubSpot, I was at thoughtbot. In my time there, I got to collaborate with clients across a variety of diverse domains, including insurance, advertising tech, health care and product manufactoring. Whether it was facilitating design sprints, helping engineers write better CSS or developing a product direction, each project was unique. The experiences also solidified a belief I've held for long time. There's no one solution that will work for everyone. Problems are contextual to orgainzations, teams and individuals.
    - I also had the good fortune of being a member of the small team that created and launched <a class="link--hp" href="http://uniform.hudl.com" target="_blank">Uniform</a>, a design system for <a class="link--hp" href="http://www.hudl.com" target="_blank">Hudl</a>. I lead css development, and ensured the underlying markup for our React components was semantic and adhered to accessibility standards.
    - Prior to Hudl, I worked at <a class="link--hp" href="http://www.upstatement.com" target="_blank">Upstatment</a> where I designed responsive web sites and ran projects working with great clients like <a class="link--hp" href="http://www.hechingerreport.org" target="_blank">The Hechinger Report</a>, <a class="link--hp" href="http://www.storey.com" target="_blank">Storey Publishing</a>, and <a class="link--hp" href="http://nieman.harvard.edu" target="_blank">The Nieman Foundation</a>.
    - In another life, I worked at the Boston Globe, where I was a designer and front end developer on editorial projects for BostonGlobe.com and Boston.com.
    - And since we're talking history, what I'm truly qualified to do is editorial design  and art direction. I had the luxury of doing that at two really fantastic newspapers, The New Orleans Times-Picayune and The Boston Globe.
    - I'm occasionally friendly. I enjoy coffee, music, running and noodling around with a solidering iron, as well as my dog and my wife; not in that order, though.
    - I've been pretty luck to work at the places I've worked at, and with the people I've worked with. Maybe we should work together.
    - How can I help? Let's chat.
