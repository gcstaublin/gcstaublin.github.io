  # intro: I'm mostly friendly. I enjoy coffee, music and running, as well as my dog and my wife; not in that order, though.
  words:
    - Most recently, I was a member of the small team that created and launched <a class="link--hp" href="http://uniform.hudl.com" target="_blank">Uniform</a>, a design system for <a class="link--hp" href="http://www.hudl.com" target="_blank">Hudl</a>. On the project, I lead css development, and ensured the underlying markup for our React components was semantic and adhered to accesibility standards. I wrangled some jsx code here and there, as well.
    - Prior to Hudl, I worked at <a class="link--hp" href="http://www.upstatement.com" target="_blank">Upstatment</a> where I designed, wrote front end code and ran projects working with great clients like <a class="link--hp" href="http://www.hechingerreport.org" target="_blank">The Hechinger Report</a>, <a class="link--hp" href="http://www.storey.com" target="_blank">Storey Publishing</a>, and <a class="link--hp" href="http://nieman.harvard.edu" target="_blank">The Nieman Foundation</a>.
    - Before jumping into client services, I worked at the Boston Globe, where I was a designer and front end developer on editorial projects for BostonGlobe.com and Boston.com.
    - And since we're talking history, I was also an editorial designer and art director for newspapers and magazines, once upon a time.
    - I'm mostly friendly. I enjoy coffee, music and running, as well as my dog and my wife; not in that order, though.
    - I love challenges of all shapes and sizes. If you have a challenge, I might be able to help. Let's chat.
