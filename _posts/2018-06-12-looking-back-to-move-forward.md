Yesterday I did an odd thing.

If you know me, you're probably thinking 'that's every day for you, Grant.'

Sure, you could think that, and you probably wouldn't be wrong.

What's this odd thing I did? I added a couple 'case studies' to my site. Well, this is exactly the type of content that should be on this site, right? Yes, but these are print-related case studies. WHAT?!? Print design? What the heck? That is odd.

It's been over five years since I sent anything to print. It's a former life. A life before I installed a code editor on my computer. I'm kicking it old school, as the kids would say. Do the kids still say that? I'm asking for a friend.

Why examine old print projects when I have plenty of digital projects that could be dissected and examined? The truth is I've planned to do case studies for some time but felt blocked. I'd think through structure, I'd sketch on paper, take screen shots and even do some writing. However, when I sat down to make those ideas reality, I couldn't do it. I'd become filled with self doubt about the direction I was about to take. I was too focused on creating the perfect case study, rather than building something and iterating on the idea. I'd start over and rethink the approach before launching anything. I was a proverbial fly in amber.

A couple weeks ago, I was looking through one of the hard drives I've hoarded over the years. I opened the folder named `My Pdfs`, and started looking through my print career. As I was reminiscing, I realized and idea was forming. I was looking at this work in much the same way one would do if they were planning to write or talk about it.

I opened Figma and began sketching out some idea. I've been using Figma lately. I've been using it for a few reasons. I liked what I saw when colleagues showed off its features. And, the Sketch license I purchased but then became a yearly subscription needs to be renewed. Test driving software and learning at the same time. That seems like a win. Afterall, if I'm going to moan about missing the features I love from InDesign, why not complain about a free piece of software, right?

After I was happy with the design direction, I didn't give myself the chance to second guess the idea. I jumped in and started building them until I had something to look at in the browser. Basically, I did what you'd do with any product. I made some prototypes. You can see them [here](/work/comeback) and [here](/work/goodbye-mike).

These are far from perfect. The writing sets up the atmosphere but barely covers process. The design could stand some refinement. The system definitely needs to be solidified and made reusable. Outside of that, I'm happy I built and pushed these out, warts and all.

I now feel more focused on what it is I want out of the case studies. And am ready for the next iteration. I also feel like I learned a few things.

While our internal compass should generally point us toward the future. Looking back on the path you've blazed can be important, if not therapeutic. The context of our experiences helps reveal where we are and where we hope to go. I was a good designer and art director. I wasn't the best. No matter what that SPD Gold Medal (shameless plug) says. The colleagues I worked with made me better. Looking at their work day after day, and week after week pushed me to be better and do better work.

I found some fond memories in those old pages. And frankly, I found a bit of confidence I had lost somewhere along the way.
