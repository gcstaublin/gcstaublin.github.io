Yesterday I did an odd thing.

If you know me, you're probably thinking 'that's every day for you, Grant.'

You could think that, and you probably wouldn't be wrong.

I added a couple 'case studies' to my site. This is exactly the type of content I should have on this site, right? Yes, but these are print-related case studies. WHAT?!? Print the design? What the heck?

It's been at least five years since I sent anything to print. It's my former life. A life before I installed a code editor on my computer. I'm kicking it old school, as the kids would say. Do the kids still say that? I'm asking for a friend.

Why examine a couple print projects when I have plenty of digital projects that could be dissected and examined? The truth is I've wanted to do case studies for some time but was blocked. I'd think through structure, I'd sketch on paper and even take screen shots. Every time I sat down to make those ideas reality, I couldn't do it. I'd feel overwhelmed and quickly become filled with self doubt about the plan. I'd second guess the approach of my paper sketch. I was too focused on creating the perfect case study, rather than just getting something out there. I was a proverbial fly in amber.

A couple weeks ago, I was looking through one of the hard drive backups I've hoarded over the years. I opened the folder named `My Pdfs`, and started looking through my print career. As I was reminiscing, I realized I was looking at this work in much the same way one would do if they were planning to write or talk about it. I had an idea.

I opened Figma and began sketching. I've been using Figma lately. I've been using it for a few reasons. I liked what I saw when colleagues showed off its features. And, the Sketch license I purchased but somehow became a yearly subscription is do to be renewed. Test driving free software and learning at the same time. That seems like a win. Afterall, if I'm going to moan about missing the features I love from InDesign, why not complain about a free piece of software, right?

I did some sketches, and started making them come true.

After I was happy with the design direction, I didn't give myself the chance to second guess the idea. I jumped in and started building them until I had something to look at in the browser. Basically, I did what you'd do with any product. I made some prototypes as a beta test.

These are far from perfect. The writing sets up the atmosphere but barely covers process. The design could stand some refinement. The system definitely needs to be solidified and made reusable. Outside of that, I'm happy I built and pushed these out, warts and all. I now feel more focused on what it is I want out of the case studies. And am ready for the next iteration.

I've always loved these two [Red Sox pages](/work/comeback), and [this page is funny](/work/goodbye-mike)

While our compass should generally be focused on the future. Looking back on the path you've blazed can be important, if not therapeutic. I was a good designer and art director. I wasn't the best. No matter what that SPD Gold Medal (shameless plug) says. The colleagues I worked with made me better. Looking at their work day after day and week after week pushed me to be better and do better work.

I found some fond memories in those old pages. Frankly, I found a bit of confidence I had lost somwhere along the way.
