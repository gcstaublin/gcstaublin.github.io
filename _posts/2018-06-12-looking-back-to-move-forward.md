Yesterday I did an odd thing.

If you know me, you're probably thinking 'that's every day for you, Grant.' You could think that, and you probably wouldn't be wrong.

I added a couple 'case studies' to my site. This is exactly the type of content I should have on this site, right? Yes, but these examine print design projects. WHAT?!? Print the design? What the heck?

It's been at least five years since I sent anything to print. It's my former life, before I installed a code editor on my computer. I am really kicking it old school, as the kids would say. Do the kids still say that? I'm asking for a friend.

Why examine a couple print projects when I have plenty of digital projects that could be dissected and examined? The truth is I've wanted to do case studies for some time but was blocked. I'd think through my structure and ideas, sketch on paper and even take screen shots. Every time I sat down to make those ideas reality, I couldn't do it. I'd get overwhelmed by what I wasn't showing. I'd second guess the approach of my paper sketch. I was too focused on creating the perfect case study, rather than just getting something out there. I was a proverbial fly in amber.

A couple weeks ago, I was looking through one of the many hard drive backups I've hoarded over the years. I opened the folder name `My Pdfs`, and started looking through my print career. As I was reminiscing, I realized I was looking at this work in much the same way one would do if they were going to write or talk about it. I had an idea.

I opened Figma and began sketching. I've been using Figma lately for a few reasons. I liked what I saw when colleagues showed off it features. And, that Sketch license I purchased but then became a yearly subscription is do to be renewed. Free and learning win almost every time. I mean, if I'm going to complain how a piece of software is missing the features I love about Indesign, why not complain about a free piece of software, right?

So I did some sketches, and started making them come true.

I didn't give myself the chance to second guess the idea. I kept going until I had something to look at in the browser. Basically, I did the exact thing one should do with any product. I made some quick prototypes as a beta test.

These are far from perfect. The writing sets up the atmosphere but barely covers process. The design needs refinement. The system could be solidified and reusable. But I'm happy that I pushed these out, warts and all. I now feel more focused on what it is I want out of the case studies.

While our compass should generally put us toward the future. Looking back on the path you've blazed can be important, if not therapeutic. I was a good designer and art director. I wasn't the best. No matter what that SPD Gold Medal (shameless plug) says. The colleagues I worked with made me better. Looking at their work day after day and week after week made me hungry to be better and do better work.

I found some fond memories in those old pages. Frankly, I found a bit of confidence I was struggling to regain.
