Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

{% highlight scss linenos %}
$primary-color-text:   #FFFFFF;
$accent-color:        #FF5252;
$primary-text-color:   #212121;
$secondary-text-color: #727272;
$divider-color:       #B6B6B6;
{% endhighlight %}

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
