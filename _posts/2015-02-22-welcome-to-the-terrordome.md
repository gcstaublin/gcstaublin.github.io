Welcome. Where shall I begin?

For a few years, I've been planning to rebuild my website. The previous site, which had a copyright that hadn't been updated for two years, was dated; figuratively and literally.

The portfolio of the old site did a really fine job of highlighting my previous careers as an art director and designer. The print work was good, in many cases award-winning. And in one case, gold medal winning work. What the old site didn't do is present me as someone who can make websites. Reportedly, I can make websites. Sometimes, those websites are quite good.

So why did it take me two years to rethink my website. That's a good question.

If you're not a designer, you may not now this, but designers are terrible when the client is themselves. All designers might not be terrible clients, but I certainly am. Conservatively, I would estimate I designed five new websites for myself over the past couple years, trashing all of them. Not just walking away, but move the document to the trash, emptying the trash kind of walking away.

So why now? Why is this moment so special? And are we to believe you're going to be a better client for yourself?

It's not special. I'm definitely not a better client for myself. It's just time.

This year I resolved to tackle the ever growing list of projects, and random ideas I jot into notebooks, ideas that sit around, unfulfilled. Among that lists of ideas, are article ideas. Articles I thought would make for a reference point, realizations or things I've learned making websites the past few years. Articles that might serve as a reference for myself, saving me from digging through websites I built six months ago, searching to remember how I did that one sweet trick.

Yeah, I wanted to become a blogger. Or at least have section of my site that facilitated writing words. These words. The words that come next. And these words, too.

To ensure I didn't build yet another soon-to-be-trashed website, I gave myself about an hour, maybe two in Indesign to push things around and come up with semi-coherent direction that I could build. After those couple hours, I jumped right into code. I set up the git repository, I installed Jekyll, I got my Grunt tasks set up, and I begin writing code.

The result isn't pretty. The type is unrefined. The overall design looks like it was done in two hours. And during those two hours designing, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the designer was watching TV, or distracted in some other meaningful manner. The code is a jumble of stuff cobbled together. No browser testing. No breakpoints checks. Just banging away, building a thing.

Now that it'slaunched, there is always tomorrow to figure out what I want this to become, or how I want it look. It's flawed probably looks terrible in many contexts, but I'm cool with that, for today.
