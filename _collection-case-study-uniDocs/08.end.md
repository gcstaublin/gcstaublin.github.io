I'm proud of the work I did on uniDocs. However, it was a symptom of an overall documentation problem we had with our system. Our CSS and HTML was documented here. The design philosophies were documented on another site. React component APIs were documented on GitHub. Users had trouble finding the information they sought. We knew this was an issue for quite some time, but stopping progress on component development and creating one, universal documentation site wasn't in the cards, until late 2017. We combined all our documentation into <a class="link--work" href="http://uniform.hudl.com" target="_blank">a new lovely site</a> early this Spring.
