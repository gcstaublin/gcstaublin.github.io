Design system documentation is not easy to do well. How’s that for an obvious opening statement? Look around the Internet, and you’ll find plenty of excellent examples of documentation sites that are done really well. However, borrowing great ideas from them is not a guarantee the one you build will resonate with your users. Writing is difficult in and of itself. Add to that, the complexity of relaying technical information for a diverse audience consisting, of front-end engineers, back-end engineers and designers, and you’ve got yourself a tasty challenge. The tone needs to inform but not talk down to or alienate. Making the wrong assumptions about users do and do not know might be the deciding factor whether they adopt the system or not. This is the challenge we faced with Uniform-UI-Docs, and how I attempted to satisfy those concerns in documenting our CSS library.
