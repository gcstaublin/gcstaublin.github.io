Sprinkled throughout uniDocs are highlighted notes. There were two main type of notes on the site: informative and critical. A critical note warned users of changes or issues they should be aware of. The informative notes communicated key information that might help a user better understand why the Uniform team made a given decision, the importance of using semantic HTML, etc. I often referred to the informative notes as a "dime's worth of knowledge." Simple, short notes that would impart knowledge. We had a diverse set of users doing front-end development and coming to our site for information and answers. I the site wanted to be as informative as possible without being too intrusive or slowing down a task someone was there to accomplish. The notes were definitely opt-in.
