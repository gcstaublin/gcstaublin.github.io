Sprinkled throughout the uniDocs site are highlighted notes that were designed to communicate key information that might help a user better understand why the Uniform team made a given decision, or the importance of using semantic HTML, etc. I often referred to them as a "dime's worth of knowledge." Simple, short notes that would impart knowledge a user might not otherwise understand. We had a diverse set of users doing front-end development and coming to our site for information and answers. So I wanted to be as informative as possible without being too intrusive or slowing down the task a user was there to accomplish. The notes were definitely opt-in.
