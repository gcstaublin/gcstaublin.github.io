The Uniform Design System had a total of 16 possible background color options in two different environments (dark and light) available to use. When we added theming to the design system, I knew I wanted to give users the ability to see the component and  interact with those potential shades of gray and black, as well as how the component itself changes, based on whether it's was in a dark or light environment. The result is both really useful and a delightful way to kill a few minutes. I doubt there was ever a time I was working on the site where I didn't flip the environment switch and click a few levels here and there.
