The Uniform Design System provides a total of 16 possible background color options across two different environments (dark and light). When we added theming to the design system, I knew I wanted to give users the ability to see the component in the context of those potential shades of gray and black. These controls also trigger the changes for the component, based on whether it's in a dark or light environment. The result is both really useful and a delightful way to kill a few minutes. I doubt there was ever a time I was working on the site where I didn't flip the environment switch and click a few levels here and there.
