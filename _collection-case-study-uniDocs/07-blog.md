As I mentioned, Uniform had a user base with a diverse skill set. We had .Net developers touching our front-end code. We had UI designers, dipping their toes into our front-end code. And we had front-end engineers touching our code. For many, CSS and HTML wasn't a first or even second language. As a way of filling in these holes, I spent a few days of downtime creating and seeding a uniDocs blog with a small set of articles, outlining how to effectively use pieces of uniCSS. I always tried to think of Uniform as a choose your own adventure product. It's unlikely users would be able to go all in on the system at once. Refactoring an existing micro-service and fully adopt the system might be too costly in terms of time and risk. However, adopting portions of the system as they make minor improvements is doable. To that end, the blog articles outlined strategies for utilizing pieces of the system without refactoring wholesale. In addition to the blog, we occasionally held talks about writing CSS, using our React components and the philosophies of the Uniform Design System, overall. I took the opportunity of developing blog to make the rest of the site responsive.
