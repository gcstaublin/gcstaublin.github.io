As I mentioned, Uniform had a user base with a diverse skill set. We had .Net developers touching our front-end code. We had UI designers, dipping their toes into our front-end code. And we had front-end engineers touching our code. For many, CSS and HTML wasn't a first or even second language. As a way of filling in these holes, I spent a few days of downtime creating and seeding a uniDocs blog with a small set of articles, outlining how to effectively use pieces of uniCSS. I always tried to think of Uniform as a choose your own adventure product. It's unlikely that our users would be able to go all in, refactor their micro-service and fully adopt the system, but it is likely users could adopt portions of it. To that end, the blog articles outlined strategies for utilizing pieces of the system without refactoring wholesale. In addition to the blog, we occasionally held talks about writing CSS, using our React components and the philosophies of the Uniform Design System, overall.
