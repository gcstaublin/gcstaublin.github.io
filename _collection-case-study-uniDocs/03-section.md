The component pages are a hard working. Users coming to one of these pages should get all the information they needed about a given component. The available features expanded as the system itself became more robust. Initially, each component page displayed the component and the possible variations, along with the associated HTML and CSS. Over time we added theming as well as simple examples of the corresponding React component, linking to that component on GitHub. Adding features to these pages was a unique design and development challenge. With each iteration, I strived to improve the legacy code I'd left myself, repeating myself less and making it easier for others to understand and add content if I were to get hit by a bus or just be unavailable.
