The component pages are hard working. Users coming to one of these pages should get all the information they needed about a given component. The functionality expanded as the system itself became more robust. Initially, each component page displayed the component and possible variants of that component, the associated HTML and CSS. Users wanting to grab the HTML were provide a button to copy the code pattern that they could then paste into their own project. Over time we added theming and examples of the corresponding React component, which linked to that component on GitHub. Adding features to these pages was a unique design and development challenge. With each iteration, I strived to improve the legacy code I'd left myself, repeating myself less and making it easier for others to understand and add content if I were to get hit by a bus or just be unavailable.
