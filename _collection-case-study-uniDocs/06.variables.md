Initially, our color variable pages were created with a yaml file I maintained and updated. Each color section had custom descriptions that explained how to use the colors, linking off to more comprehensive descriptions, when that was available. However, as we solidified a token system to ensure all colors across all platforms had a single source of truth, we lost the custom descriptions. I felt those descriptions were important in the context of uniDocs. I spent the better half of an afternoon, figuring out how simultaneously loop over to different yaml files, creatining he color list and providing the descriptions. Like I said working on this site made me a better developer and satisfied my ability to be a glutton for punishment.
