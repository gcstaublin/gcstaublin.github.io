The first thing users saw arriving on the uniDocs homepage was short descriptions of recent releases, linking to the full release notes on GitHub. I took pride in writing very detailed release notes, making sure users had all the information they needed when deciding to upgrade. I know I don't want like when software pull the rug out from underneath me with updates, so I tried to ensure our users wouldn't get hit with time sucking surprises. Additionally, the homepage provided links to the GitHub repos for our CSS library and our React components, as well as the separate designer-specific documentation site.
