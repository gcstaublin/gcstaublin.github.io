Users arriving on the Uniform-UI-Docs (uniDocs) homepage were greeted with a useful, informative homepage. One challenge we encountered communicating with a product team of over 200 people was it's quite easy for our users to miss the announcement of a given release. Slack messages are ephemeral. I wanted our homepage to make it easier to discover key improvements that might have otherwise been missed. The list of recent releases focused not on every release, but notable releases: the addition of a new component, a fix or other important changes. These teases linked to the full release notes on GitHub. I took pride in writing comprehensive release notes, ensuring users had all the information they needed when deciding whether to upgrade or not. The last thing we wanted, as burgeoning design system was to alienate users by not adequately preparing them for an upgrade. The rest of the homepage outlined other pieces of the Uniform system: our design guidelines, our React component library, as well as the blog associated with the uniDocs site.
