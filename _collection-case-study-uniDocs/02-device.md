Users arriving on the Uniform-UI-Docs (uniDocs) homepage were greeted with a useful, informative homepage. One challenge we encountered communicating with a product team of over 200 people was how easy it is for our users to miss the announcement of a new release. Slack messages are ephemeral. Articles on the company intranet site are often a prime candidate for what not to read. I wanted our homepage to make it easier for users to discover key improvements that might have otherwise been missed. The list of recent releases focused not on every release, but notable releases: the addition of a new component, a fix or other important changes. These teases linked to the full release notes on GitHub. I took pride in writing comprehensive release notes, ensuring users had all the information they needed when deciding whether to upgrade or not. The last thing we wanted, as a burgeoning design system was to alienate users by not adequately preparing them for an upgrade. Upgrades can be challenging enough when you know what to expect. I wanted to make sure we were not pulling the rug out from underneath our users. The rest of the homepage outlined other pieces of the Uniform system: our design guidelines, our React component library, as well as the blog associated with the uniDocs site.
